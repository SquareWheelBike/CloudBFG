# BattSim battery simulator

BattSim is an algorithm created by Dr. Bala Balasingham at uWindsor, for simulating a battery with proper characteristics.

## Octave

The octave folder contains the files modified to work with GNU octave. This means no X11 functionality, so no plotting.

## Python

The python folder contains an (unfinished) conversion of the matlab algorithm into python.
