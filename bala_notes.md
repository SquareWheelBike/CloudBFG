- good start, but we need  more details
- what  are we doing a NN for,  what are  we training on, what is SOC estimations, what are the OCV-SOC models, what are the features of the cloud page, we  can  use one of our lab  templates for the presentation, 

There were more points, I thought he moved  on to something else so I missed it; it will be in the  lab recording

## round 2???

- battery characterization in title first, also maybe shorten the title? (note: we picked a long one because everyone else's is long)
- Move over to the template online
- include some generated data from online open source content
- we need to think about making this in a way that it indicates what our final product will be
- Need diagrams of our web framework // mqtt connections
- we need to explain why we need a neural network and how we are going to train it
- We need a deliverables slide
- include a bunch of details on what is happening on the cloud side
